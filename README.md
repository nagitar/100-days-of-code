# 100-days-of-code
100 Days of Code Challenge has been initiated by freeCodeCamp and Alexander Kallaway is doing awesome work for the good of community. We are initiating this challenge for our College Students at MCA (KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad) and would be working with similar set of rules and guidelines.
